        During this module I was task to make a fully functional website with full access of how I wanted it to look. I
        had a couple of instructions to follow such as what pages should be including within my website. The experience
        of learning different skills such as coding and designing enabled me to broaden my skill type. I have previously
        never made a website before in a sense of coding and ensuing it works. Therefore, I did have some difficulty of

        with the process of making the website, I wanted to ensure I had a colour scheme which fitted what I liked.

        thoroughly enjoyed the process of making a website as it was something I have never done before. Even with the
        difficulty I had I ensured not to give and keep going making small changes. For this module I had to use both
